AI and chatbots can also provide customer service and support to tourists by answering frequently asked questions, providing directions, and assisting with bookings and reservations. This can help alleviate stress and frustration for tourists, especially in unfamiliar locations.

Assistance with Travel Planning

AI and chatbots can assist with travel planning by providing information on flights, accommodations, and transportation options. This can help tourists make informed decisions and save time and effort in planning their trip.

Multilingual Support
